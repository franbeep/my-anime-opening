# My Anime Opening

## Motivation

As someone that have watched a*a lot* of anime over the years, I have simply forgotten most of the OST on them, and it occured to me to create a system to gather all openings/endings from my MAL account.

This proposed project is supposed to gather your list, procure the list of music in a video streaming source (YouTube in this case), and generate the list. However, due to quota limits, I have simply disabled the last part, so it only generates a list of music in `json` format.

## Technologies used

This is just a memo for me.

- NextJS (React)
- Axios
- JikanJS API
- Rxjs
- Redux

## Optimizations backlog

- Remove the extra space at the bottom
- Generate playlist with user's permission (key)
- Revamp the visuals

### Thanks! ❤️
